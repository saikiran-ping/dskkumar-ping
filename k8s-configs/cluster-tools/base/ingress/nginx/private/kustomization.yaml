### SELECTOR UPDATE ###
# Because the selector path is deleted in base, we do a strategic merge patch to add all labels
#
# IMPORTANTLY, we add the 'app: ingress-nginx' label which is new with P1AS 1.19.1
# This new label allows us to upgrade future deployments without having to recreate the deployment resource itself,
# while also migrating off of the existing deployment which has the same selector labels.
# When upgrading the new Deployment can be created after the old one is orphaned and the new Deployment will select the
# new pods but not the old, orphaned ones, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
# See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#selector
#
# Meanwhile, the Service selects any previous or new pods allowing for zero downtime upgrades
